# Volatility Forecasting with GARCH

This repository provides an implementation of volatility forecasting using the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. The GARCH model is widely used in financial econometrics to capture time-varying volatility in asset returns. The forecasting process incorporates Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) and Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots, as well as Walk-Forward Validation.

## Introduction

Volatility forecasting plays a crucial role in financial risk management and portfolio optimization. This repository aims to provide a robust framework for volatility forecasting using the GARCH model. It includes preprocessing techniques for financial time series data, implementation of the GARCH model, model evaluation metrics, and visualization tools.

## Installation

To use this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- pprint
- yfinance
- pandas
- sqlite3
- numpy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Ashraf-Khalil/Volatility-forecasting-garch.git
```

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your financial time series data by ensuring it is in a suitable CSV format and updating the data in sqlite Database .

2. Use the preprocessing techniques provided This step involves handling missing values, normalizing the data and preparation before the model.

3. Utilize `garch` model to estimate the model parameters, compute volatility forecasts, and generate conditional variance series.

4. Evaluate the performance of the GARCH model using various statistical metrics. Visualize the forecasts and compare them with the actual volatility using the plotting functions available.

5. Perform Walk-Forward Validation. This approach helps assess the model's performance by iteratively training and evaluating the GARCH model on expanding windows of data.

## Methodology

The GARCH model is implemented based on the well-established econometric theory. It captures the time-varying volatility by modeling the conditional variance of the asset returns. The model estimation process involves finding the optimal values for the GARCH parameters using maximum likelihood estimation.

The PACF and ACF plots are employed to analyze the autocorrelation structure of the asset returns. These plots help determine the appropriate lag orders for the GARCH model, enabling better forecasting performance.

## Walk-Forward Validation

Walk-Forward Validation is a robust technique used to evaluate the performance of the GARCH model. It involves training the model on a rolling window of historical data and making one-step-ahead forecasts. The process is repeated iteratively, incorporating new observations and re-estimating the model parameters at each step. This validation approach provides a more realistic assessment of the model's predictive ability.

## Results

The repository includes examples and case studies that demonstrate the application of the GARCH model for volatility forecasting. These examples cover various financial assets such as stocks, currencies, and commodities. The results are presented in a clear and interpretable manner, showcasing the accuracy and usefulness of the GARCH model in predicting volatility.
